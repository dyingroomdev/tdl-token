anchor test
```

### Devnet Deployment Snippets

```bash
# Build + deploy the presale program (writes artifacts/addresses.*.json)
npm run presale:deploy:devnet

# Initialise a sale using configs/devnet.json
npm run presale:init -- \
  --tdl-mint <TDL_MINT> \
  --pay-mint <PAY_MINT> \
  --config configs/devnet.json

## Presale Program

The presale logic for vesting, whitelist management, and post-sale claims lives in the standalone Anchor program under `programs/tdl_presale`. Running `anchor build` emits the IDL to `sdk/idl/tdl_presale.json` and TypeScript bindings to `sdk/types/tdl_presale.ts`, which are re-exported via `sdk/index.ts` for use in downstream tooling.

### Presale Tooling

- **CLI (`scripts/presale-cli.ts`)** ‚Äì wraps initialise, buy, claim, refund, whitelist, pause and reporting commands. Invoke with `npm run presale -- --help`.
- **Automation scripts** ‚Äì see `scripts/*.ts` for deploy, init, whitelist import, buy/claim simulations, refunds, and postmortem reports. All emit artefacts under `artifacts/`.
- **SDK (`sdk/`)** ‚Äì provides `TdlPresaleClient` helpers used by scripts, tests, and the DApp. Import via `@sdk` alias inside the app or from downstream packages.
- **Tests (`tests/presale/presale.spec.ts`)** ‚Äì mocha suite covering caps, whitelist enforcement, refunds, vesting, and guard controls. Run with `npx ts-mocha -p tsconfig.json -t 1000000 tests/presale/**/*.ts`.

### Presale DApp

A React + Vite dashboard lives in `app/` featuring:

- Live sale status, timelines, and progress
- Buyer participation form (whitelist-aware)
- Vesting claims with real-time unlock calculations
- Admin console for pause, whitelist uploads, and treasury withdrawals

Configure via `app/.env` (see `.env.example`) and launch locally with `npm run app:dev`.
